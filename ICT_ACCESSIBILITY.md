# Accessibility Conformance Testing

1. Use the aXe browser add-on to check for errors. There are certain warnings that occur that do not apply.
2. Use NVDA to attempt using the page. The page may need to be re-arranged to make sense for screen readers.

# Feedback/Requests

If there is an accessibility error that we are not aware of, please notify us via your POC. If the error has to do with the framework and not the individual page then create an issue on our open source project to make us aware of it: <https://github.com/workflowproducts/envelope/issues>
